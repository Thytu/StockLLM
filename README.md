## About The Project

StockLLM represents a initiative focusing on refining chess instruction and language modeling through the fine-tuning of a Large Language Model. This project encompasses two pivotal components, each engineered to enhance and streamline the comprehension and dissemination of chess-related knowledge:

### StockLLM (Work in Progress)
StockLLM stands as an ongoing endeavor aimed at developing a highly specialized Large Language Model tailored explicitly for the domain of chess instruction.
StockLLM endeavors to distill and encode intricate chess-related concepts, strategies, and instructional nuances into a language-based model.

Key Features of StockLLM (WIP):

* **Fine-tuned Specialization**: Through meticulous fine-tuning on curated chess instructional datasets, StockLLM seeks to encapsulate the inherent complexities and strategic depth of chess gameplay within its language-based representations.
* **Advanced Contextual Understanding**: StockLLM aims to grasp the subtleties of chess moves, positions, tactics, and strategic principles, fostering an enriched understanding for instructional purposes.
* **Adaptive Learning Capabilities**: The model aspires to adapt dynamically to diverse skill levels, providing tailored guidance, analyses, and instructional content catering to beginners, intermediate, and advanced players alike.

### ChessInstruct Dataset
The [ChessInstruct](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Thytu/ChessInstruct) Dataset serves as the foundation for training and fine-tuning Language Models (LLMs) specifically in the realm of chess instruction.
Derived from the [laion/strategic_game_chess](https://huggingface.co/datasets/laion/strategic_game_chess) dataset, this meticulously curated dataset encompasses a wide array of annotated instructional chess content.

Features of the ChessInstruct Dataset:

* **Rich and Diverse Content**: Curated with a broad spectrum of instructional resources including annotated games, strategic analyses (incoming) and positional evaluations, the dataset facilitates comprehensive learning and modeling.
* **Customizable Training Resource**: The ChessInstruct Dataset allows for the tailored fine-tuning of any Language Model, enabling researchers and practitioners to adapt and optimize LLMs for chess-specific instructional contexts.
* **Annotated Instructional Insights**: Detailed annotations and instructional cues within the dataset provide valuable guidance for language model training, emphasizing strategic moves, tactics, and decision-making processes.

StockLLM, in conjunction with the ChessInstruct Dataset, aims to propel the boundaries of language modeling in the domain of chess instruction.
Through nuanced linguistic representations and tailored instructional datasets, this project envisions revolutionizing the efficacy and depth of chess education by harnessing the power of advanced Natural Language Processing.

## Roadmap

### Dataset
- [x] Change intermediate output format to parquet
- [x] Generate an intermediate dataset agnostic to any model's prompt format
- [x] Generate move evaluation localy by running a StockFish server
- [ ] Add a new task "detect illegal move"
- [ ] Add a new task "find WIN/DRAW/LOSE stats"
- [ ] Generate game strategic analyses
- [ ] Create an use `LABEL_PROMPT` to improve model's output format
- [ ] (Diverse) Add an evaluation section to evaluate StockLLM agains StockFish
- [ ] Check for additional dataset to base ChessInstruct on

### Model
- [ ] Provide training as dvc step
- [ ] Provided trained version of StockLLM
- [ ] Find StockLLM's ELO


See the [open issues](https://github.com/Thytu/StockLLM/issues) for a full list of proposed features and known issues.
